## Reference scenario

The big-data cube
- Volume: small to big
- Variety: structure to unstructured
- Velocity: pull to push

---

Variety
- Structured
  - Relational tuples with FK/PK relationships
- Unstructured
  - Key-value
  - Columnar
  - Document-based
  - Graph
  - ...

Velocity (latency)
- High: clients synchronously pulling data from sources
- Low: sources asynchronously pushing data to clients

Velocity (speed; dual to latency)
- High: processing in real-time (milliseconds) or near-real time (minutes)
- Low: processing can take hours

Acceleration
- Velocity is not constant, data comes in bursts
- Take Twitter as an example
  - Hashtags can become hugely popular and appear hundreds of times in just seconds
  - … or slow down to one tag an hour
- Your system must be able to efficiently handle the peak as well as the lows

---

Collecting data
- Scheduled Batch
  - Large volume of data processed on a regular scheduled basis
  - Velocity is very predictable
- Periodic:
  - Data processed at irregular times (e.g., after collecting a certain ---large--- amount of data)
  - Velocity is less predictable
- Near real-time
  - Streaming data processed in small individual batches collected and processed within minutes
  - Velocity is a huge concern
- Real-time
  - Streaming data collected and processed in very small individual batches within milliseconds
  - Velocity is the paramount concern

---

Processing data

- Batch and periodic
  - Once data has been collected, processing can be done in a controlled environment
  - There is time to plan for the appropriate resources
- Near real-time and real-time
  - Collection of the data leads to an immediate need for processing
  - Depending on the complexity of the processing (cleansing, scrubbing, curation), this can slow down the velocity of the solution significantly
  - Plan accordingly

---

Plus other Vs
  * **Veracity**: data trustworthiness/quality
  * **Value**: ability to extract meaningful information
  * ...

Our focus
  * (Un)Structured big-data batch
  * (Un)Structured big-data streams

**Goal**: keep in mind the cube to
categorize the cloud services

## Data-driven companies

<span style="color:#FF5050">Data-driven company </span> refers to companies where decisions and processes are supported by data
  * Decisions are based on quantitative rather than qualitative knowledge
  * Processes & Knowledge are an asset of the company and are not lost if managers change
  * The gap between a data-driven decision and a good decision is a good manager

Adopting a data-driven mindset goes far beyond adopting a business intelligence solution and entails:
  * Create a data culture
  * Change the mindset of managers
  * Change processes
  * Improve the quality of all the data

## Reference scenario

Scenario 1
  * My business has a set of 15 JSON data files that are each about 2.5 GB in size.
  * They are placed on a file server once an hour, and they must be ingested as soon as they arrive in this location.
  * Data must be combined with all transactions from financial dashboard for this same period, then compared to the recommendations from marketing engine
  * All data is fully cleansed.
  * The results from this time period must be made available to decision makers by 10 minutes after the hour in the form of financial dashboards.

<span style="color:#FF5050">Which Vs are involved?</span>

--

  * <span style="color:#FF5050">Volume</span> This scenario describes huge JSON files to be combined with transactional data and marketing data.
  * <span style="color:#FF5050">Velocity</span>  "Wait - now hurry up\!" Wait to collect data for a full hour and then produce meaningful results in 10 minutes  <span style="color:#0070C0">(is it batch or stream processing?)</span>
  * <span style="color:#FF5050">Variety</span>  three data source types: log files, transactional data, and recommendation information
  * <span style="color:#FF5050">Value</span>  populate dashboards that are used by decision makers as soon as they are made available. The value is reached because it requires an understanding of what the organization is trying to accomplish


---

## Reference scenario

Scenario 2
  * My business compiles data generated by hundreds of corporations.
  * This data is delivered to us in very large files, transactional updates, and even data streams.
  * The data must be cleansed and prepared to ensure that rogue inputs do not skew the results.
  * Knowing the data source for each record is vital to the work we do.
  * A large portion of the data gathered is irrelevant to our analysis, so this data must be eliminated.
  * The final requirement is that all data must be combined and loaded into our data warehouse, where it will be analyzed.

<span style="color:#FF5050">Which Vs are involved?</span>

--

Which Vs are involved?
  * <span style="color:#FF5050">Volume</span>  The data is delivered in very large files, transactional updates, and even in data streams
  * <span style="color:#FF5050">Variety</span>  The business will need to combine the data from all three sources into a single data warehouse.
  * <span style="color:#FF5050">Veracity</span>  The data is known to be suspect. The data must be cleansed and prepared to ensure that rogue inputs do not skew the results. Knowing the data source for each record is vital to the work we do.

## Why going cloud? Data-driven companies

<span style="color:#FF5050">Digitalization</span>  is a journey that involves three main dimensions
  * Moving from  A to B is a multi-year process made of intermediate goals
  * Each of which must be  <span style="color:#FF5050">feasible</span>
    * Solves a company pain and brings value
    * Can be accomplished in a limited time range (typically less than one year)
    * Costs must be economically related to gains

## Why going cloud?

**Cloud computing** (National Institute of Standards and Technology)
> "A model for enabling <span style="color:#FF0000">ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand </span> network access to a <span style="color:#0070C0">shared pool</span>  of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with <span style="color:#00B050">minimal management effort </span> or service provider interaction."

  * On-demand self-service (consume services when you want)
  * Broad network access (consume services from anywhere)
  * Resource pooling (infrastructure, virtual platforms, and applications)
  * Rapid elasticity (enable horizontal scalability)
  * Measured service (pay for the service you consume as you consume)

Digital transformation involves the cloud to create/change business flows
  * Often involves changing the company culture to adapt to this new way of doing business
  * One of the end goal is to meet ever-changing business and market demand

---

## Why going cloud?

Goal: adjusts capacity to have predictable performance at the lowest cost

**Scalability** that is not possible on premises
  * Scale from one to thousands of servers

**Elasticity**
  * Automatically scale resources in response to run-time conditions
  * Adapt to changes in workload by turning on/off resources to match the necessary capacity
  * Core justification for the cloud adoption

---

## Why going cloud?

Hardware scalability
  * No longer think about rack space, switches, and power supplies, etc.

Grow storage from GBs to PBs
  * 1PB: one hundred 10TB Enterprise Capacity 3.5 HDD hard drives

## Why going cloud?

**Resource pooling**
  * Enable  <span style="color:#FF5050">cost-sharing</span>, a resource to serve different consumers
  * Resources are dynamically reassigned according to demands
  * Based on  <span style="color:#FF5050">virtualization</span>, <span style="color:#FF5050"> </span> running multiple virtual instances on top of a physical computer system
  * Economy of scale for physical resources

**Reliability**
  * Built to handle failures
  * Fault-tolerant or highly available

---

## Why going cloud?

**Worldwide deployment**
  * Deploy applications as close to customers as possible
    * E.g., to reduce network latency
  * Improve data locality
  * Compliant to privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR)

**Measured quality of service**
  * Services leverage a quantitative qualitative metering capability making pay-as-you-go (or pay-per-use) billing and validation of the service quality available

---

## Why going cloud?

**Service integration**
  * Do not reinvent the wheel, eliminate repetitive tasks
    * Use services that solve common problems (e.g., load balancing, queuing)
  * Abstract and automatically adapt the architecture to requirements
    * E.g., create (test) environments on demand
  
<span style="color:#FF5050">Integration</span>  and  <span style="color:#FF5050">abstraction</span>  are drivers of change
  * From  <span style="color:#0070C0">databases</span>  to  <span style="color:#0070C0">data platforms</span>
  * From  <span style="color:#0070C0">on-premises</span>  to  <span style="color:#0070C0">serverless</span>  architectures
  * From  <span style="color:#0070C0">custom</span>  to  <span style="color:#0070C0">standardized</span>  data pipelines

## Cloud computing: types of cloud

There are different types of cloud
  * **Public**: accessible to anyone willing to pay (e.g., Microsoft, AWS, Google)
  * **Private**: accessible by individuals within an institution
    * In public cloud, any resources that you are not using can be used by other
    * Users share the costs
    * Cost-sharing disappears in private clouds
  * **Hybrid**: a mix of the previous

---

## Cloud computing: types of cloud

Cloud services are hosted in separate geographic areas
  * Locations are composed of **regions** and **availability zones**

Region (e.g., `us-east-1`)
  * Is an independent geographical area that groups data centers
  * Has availability zones

Availability zones in a region
  * A data center
  * Connected through low-latency links
  * Resources are usually replicated across zones but not regions

  * Gartner Magic Quadrant: Understanding the technology providers to consider for an investment
  * **Leaders** execute well and are well positioned for tomorrow
  * **Visionaries** understand where the market is going but do not yet execute well
  * **Niche Players** focus successfully on a small segment, or are unfocused and do not out-innovate or outperform others
  * **Challengers** execute well but do not demonstrate an understanding of market direction
  * Focusing on leaders isn't always the best
    * A niche player may support needs better than a market leader. It depends on how the provider aligns with business goals

## Cloud computing: deployment models

On a cloud architecture, you can rely on  <span style="color:#FF5050">serverless</span>  or  <span style="color:#FF5050">managed </span> services
<span style="color:#FF5050">Serverless</span>
  * Standalone independent services built for a specific purpose and integrated by cloud service provider
  * No visibility into the machines
    * There are still servers in serverless, but they are abstracted away
    * No server management, do not have to manage any servers or scale them
    * E.g., when you run a query on [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/bigquery/separation-of-storage-and-compute-in-bigquery) you do not know how many machines were used
  * Pay for what your application uses, usually per request or per usage

<span style="color:#FF5050">(Fully) Managed</span>
  * Visibility and control of machines
    * You can choose the number of machines that are being used to run your application
  * Do not have to set up any machines, the management and backup are taken care for you
  * Pay for machine runtime, however long you run the machines and resources that your application uses

## Cloud computing: deployment models

Understanding architectures is paramount to successful systems
  * Good architectures help to scale
  * Poor architectures cause issues that necessitate a costly rewrite

**XaaS (anything as a service)**
  * A collective term that refers to the delivery of anything as a service
  * It encompasses the products, tools and technologies that vendors deliver to users

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18005592/210405724-ad5ac3ab-c8ce-459d-8fe7-a6acfc07e081.png)

---

## Cloud computing: deployment models

**On-premises**
  * Provisioning servers is time-consuming
    * A non-trivial environment is hard to set up
  * Require dedicated operations people
  * Often a distraction from strategic tasks

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18005592/210405783-859402cf-281d-4448-8d50-d57b1287b90d.png)

---

## Cloud computing: deployment models

**Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)**
  * A computing infrastructure provisioned and managed over the internet (e.g., AWS EC2)
  * Avoid expense/complexity of buying/managing physical servers/data-centers
  * IaaS overcomes issues on-premises
  * Possibly requires to manage many environments

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18005592/210406062-ea82c8da-d34c-479e-a31d-7a25ce15851f.png)

---

## Cloud computing: deployment models

**Platform as a Service (PaaS)**
  * A development and deployment environment in the cloud (e.g., AWS Elastic Beanstalk)
  * Support complete application life-cycle: building, testing, deploying, etc.
  * Avoid expense/complexity of managing licenses and application infrastructure

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18005592/210406122-6d66c2e0-c931-4617-9203-4ee02476f96c.png)

---

## Cloud computing: deployment models

**PaaS** and **containers** are potential solutions to inconsistent infrastructures
PaaS provides a platform for users to run their software
  * Developers write software targeting features/capabilities of the platform
Containerization isolates an application with its own environment
  * Lightweight alternative to full virtualization
  * Containers are isolated but need to be deployed to (public/private) server
  * Excellent solution when dependencies are in play
  * Housekeeping challenges and complexities

---

## Cloud computing: deployment models

<span style="color:#FF5050">Containers</span>  and  <span style="color:#FF5050">virtual machines </span> are packaged computing environments
<span style="color:#FF5050">Containers</span>
  * On top of physical server and its host OS
  * Share the host OS kernel
  * Shared components are read-only
  * "Light", take seconds to start
<span style="color:#FF5050">Virtual machines</span>
  * Emulate a hardware/software system
  * On top of a hypervisor (VM monitor)

---

## Cloud computing: deployment models

**Function as a Service (FaaS)**
  * A coding environment, cloud provider provisions platform to run the code (e.g., AWS Lambda)
  * Infrastructure provisioning and management are invisible to the developer

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18005592/210406221-7710ebbb-d53c-418a-8e7e-126b0a5dfa6d.png)

---

## FaaS

Principles of FaaS architectures
  * FaaS is based on a serverless approach, use a compute service to execute code on demand
  * Every function could be considered as a standalone service
  * Write single-purpose stateless functions

Functions react to events
  * Design push-based, event-driven pipelines
  * Create thicker, more powerful front ends
  * Embrace third-party services (e.g., security)

FaaS is not a silver bullet
  * Not appropriate for latency-sensitive applications
  * Strict specific service-level agreements
  * Migration costs
  * Vendor lock-in can be an issue

---

## Cloud computing: deployment models

**Software as a service (SaaS)**
  * An application environment
  * Access cloud-based apps over the Internet (e.g., email, Microsoft Office 365)
