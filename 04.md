## Context: Soil moisture monitoring

Optimizing soil moisture is crucial for watering and crop performance [1]
- GOAL: build an expert system to save water while improving fruit quality (i.e., provide a recommendation of the optimal amount of water)
- Soils have different water retention
- Watering systems have different behaviors (e.g., drippers and sprinklers)
- Plants have different water demand (e.g., Kiwi [2] vs Grapes)
- Sensors produce different measurements with different precisions

(Example) Scenarios of digital transformation in agriculture

Scenario #1
- The farmer/technician controls the watering system based only on the experience
- No digital data/KPIs/automation

Scenario #2
- The control of the watering system is refined by observing sensor data
- Sensor data is digitalized, no KPIs/automatic

Scenario #3
- Sensor data feeds a decision support system that, knowing how to optimize KPIs, controls the watering system

## Context: Soil moisture monitoring

We need to understand how the soil behaves

Simulate [1, 2] the soil behavior according to physical models [3]
  - However, a fine tuning is required
  - We need to know/parametrize everything
    - Soil (e.g., retention curve, hysteresis [3])
    - Plant (e.g., roots, LAI)
    - Weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind, precipitations)
    - Watering system (e.g., capacity, distance between drippers)

Tuning can take months (of human interactions)!
  - Need to collect samples from the field… if parameters are incorrect, trace back
  - Need to implement/code all these features into the simulator [1, 2]
  - Hyper-parameter tuning with machine learning can help, but it is not a silver bullet

## Context: Soil moisture monitoring

But... we have sensors!

- These settings are too coarse to monitor soil moisture with precision
- They require many sensors

## Reference scenario

We consider an orchard where 
- Kiwi plants are aligned along rows
- Each row has many drippers (e.g., 1 every meter)
- Drippers can water a limited soil volume

## Reference scenario

- Soil moisture is a continuum
- Sensors return a discretized representation of soil moisture
  - The monitoring accuracy changes
  - depending on the sensor layout

## Reference scenario

We consider a 2D grid of 3 x 4 gypsum block sensors
- Sample soil moisture-sensor data every 15 minutes
- Collect dripper and weather data (humidity, temperature, solar radiation, wind) every hour

How many data does each monitored field produces every season?
- `$(12 \cdot 4 \frac{𝑠𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒𝑠}{ℎ𝑜𝑢𝑟} + 5 \frac{𝑠𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒𝑠}{ℎ𝑜𝑢𝑟}) \cdot 24 \frac{ℎ𝑜𝑢𝑟}{𝑑𝑎𝑦} \cdot 30 \frac{𝑑𝑎𝑦}{𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑡ℎ} \cdot 5 \frac{𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑡ℎ}{𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟} = 200 \cdot 10^3  \frac{𝑠𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒𝑠}{𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟}$`

We monitored 6 fields for 2 years
- `$200 \cdot 10^3 \frac{𝑠𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒𝑠}{year} \cdot 2 𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟 \cdot 6=2.4 \cdot 10^6 𝑠𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒𝑠$`

We should consider accessory data for storage and optimization structures
- In two years, we collected/generated 16GB data (as of 2022-08-30)
