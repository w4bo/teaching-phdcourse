## Table of Contents and Exam

Handling data pipelines in the cloud

- Shifting **from databases to well-integrated data ecosystems**
- Definition of cloud and **taxonomy of cloud services**
- Introduction to the most relevant **cloud platforms**
- Introduction to the **billing models** that lay behind cloud computing services
- **Cluster migration**: on-premises vs on-cloud
- Real case studies

Seminars by companies working with cloud and big data platforms

Connecting the dots
- Information systems, BI, data mining, big data, and machine learning

... all these points will be part of the oral examination! :)

## Table of Contents and Exam

- Exams **must be in presence** according to the University's regulations
- Be prepared, there must be **at least one month between exam attempts**
- **All lectures (including seminars)** are subjects of questions
- **Interaction** during the lectures/labs is considered in the final evaluation

## Roadmap

- Why going cloud?
- From databases to data platforms
- Building data platforms
- Creating data pipelines in the cloud (in AWS)
- Billing and cloud migration

## So far

You have acquainted/practiced with **on-premises** solutions
- You were given a working hardware cluster
- ... to deploy software applications on Hadoop-based stack

In the perspective of digital transformation<sup>1</sup>, let us guess
- How would you start from scratch?
- How much time would it take?

<sup>1</sup> The process of using digital technologies to create new — or modify existing — business processes, culture, and customer experiences to meet changing business and market requirements

## So far

No easy answers

Big-data (distributed) architectures require a lot of skills
- **Configuration**: how do I set up dozens of new machines?
- **Networking**: how do I cable dozens of machines?
- **Management**: how do I replace a broken disk?
- **Upgrade**: how do I extend the cluster with new services/machines?
- (energy and cooling, software licenses, insurance...)

## So far

Two sides of the same coin
- **Technological** perspective
  - How do we configure a distributed environment?
  - How do we set up/integrate/control independent services?
  - How do we orchestrate data flows?
- **Business** perspective
  - Can we afford to spend resources on tasks that are not mission oriented?
  - No free lunch, each choice has cost/benefit
  - How much time does it take to master a technology?
  - How many people do I need?

... but first, which are our **data needs**?

## Teaching material

You will find all you need in these slides.

However, keeping up the pace with data platforms and cloud is hard
- There is a rapid development of technologies, and not all of them will survive
- Books are easily outdated with respect to cutting-edge services and technologies
- Research papers (often) describe solutions that are not commercial yet
- (IRL) You will need to dial with a lot of (bad) documentation, online articles, etc.

Rule of thumb
- Understand the general concepts 
- Do not be afraid of change
